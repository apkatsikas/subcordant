# subcordant

## TODOs
* Testability - we have to do a delay
* Testing errors and enqueing, one song, multiple songs
* Let album end then enque, or while playing - test these
* Kick bot
* Properly handle errors
* Say what the album name is
* Support playlist
* DOn't emit that ffmpeg was cancelled
* Figure out error with ride - fc9bf7bb3a0c6c4218112c72fedb0a29 - album id

## Scenarios to test
* Stream from subsonic is slower than reading the file from ffmpeg

### Pre-requisites
* Install ffmpeg
* Create Discord bot
